  <h1>Colophon</h1>
  <p>This specification is authored on <a href="https://github.com/Ecma-TC54/ECMA-424">GitHub</a> in a plaintext source format called <a href="https://github.com/tc39/ecmarkup">Ecmarkup</a>. Ecmarkup is an HTML and Markdown dialect that provides a framework and toolset for authoring ECMA specifications in plaintext and processing the specification into a full-featured HTML rendering that follows the editorial conventions for this document. Ecmarkup builds on and integrates a number of other formats and technologies including <a href="https://github.com/rbuckton/grammarkdown">Grammarkdown</a> for defining syntax and <a href="https://github.com/tc39/ecmarkdown">Ecmarkdown</a> for authoring algorithm steps. PDF renderings of this specification are produced using a print stylesheet which takes advantage of the CSS Paged Media specification and is converted using <a href="https://www.princexml.com/">PrinceXML</a>.</p>
  <p>We extend our gratitude to TC39 for their exceptional work in developing Ecmarkup, which has greatly facilitated TC54's successful adoption of this tool for the preparation and maintenance of our technical specifications.</p>
  <p>Prior editions of this specification were transformed using Word, automated editing of Open Office XML, and Pandoc.</p>
