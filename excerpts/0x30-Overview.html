    <h1>Overview of CycloneDX</h1>
    <p>
        CycloneDX is a modern standard for the software supply chain. At its core, CycloneDX is a general-purpose Bill
        of Materials (BOM) standard capable of representing software, hardware, services, and other types of inventory.
        The CycloneDX standard began in 2017 in the OWASP community. CycloneDX is an OWASP flagship project, has a
        formal standardization process and governance model, and is supported by the global information security community.
    </p>
    <emu-clause id="sec-overview-design-philosophy-and-guiding-principles">
        <h1>Design Philosophy and Guiding Principles</h1>
        <p>
            The simplicity of design is at the forefront of the CycloneDX philosophy. The format is easily understandable
            by a wide range of technical and non-technical roles. CycloneDX is a full-stack BOM format with many advanced
            capabilities that are achieved without sacrificing the design philosophy. Some guiding principles influencing
            its design include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be easy to adopt and easy to contribute to</li>
            <li>Identify risk to as many adopters as possible, as quickly as possible</li>
            <li>Avoid blockers that prevent the identification of risk</li>
            <li>Continuous improvement - innovate quickly and improve over time</li>
            <li>Encourage innovation and competition through extensions</li>
            <li>Produce immutable and backward-compatible releases</li>
            <li>Focus on high degrees of automation</li>
            <li>Provide a smooth path to specification compliance through prescriptive design</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Defining Software Bill of Materials</h3>
        <p>
            The U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) defines software bill of materials
            as "_a formal, machine-readable inventory of software components and dependencies, information about those
            components, and their hierarchical relationships_." OWASP CycloneDX implements this definition and extends
            it in many ways, including adding services as a foundational component in a Software Bill of Materials.
        </p>
        <h3>The Role of SBOM in Software Transparency</h3>
        <p>
            Software transparency involves providing clear and accurate information about the components used in an
            application, including their name, version, supplier, and any dependencies required by the component. This
            information helps identify and manage the risks associated with the software whilst also enabling compliance
            with relevant regulations and standards. With the growing importance of software in our daily lives,
            transparency is critical to building trust in software and ensuring that it is safe, secure, and reliable.
        </p>
        <p>
            SBOMs are the vehicle through which software transparency can be achieved. With SBOMs, parties throughout
            the software supply chain can leverage the information within to enable various use cases that would not
            otherwise be easily achievable. SBOMs play a vital role in promoting software transparency, allowing users
            to make informed decisions about the software they use.
        </p>
        <h2>High-Level SBOM Use Cases</h2>
        <p>
            A complete and accurate inventory of all first-party and third-party components is essential for risk
            identification. SBOMs should ideally contain all direct and transitive components and the dependency
            relationships between them.
        </p>
        <p>
            CycloneDX far exceeds the <a href="https://www.ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_minimum_elements_report.pdf">Minimum Elements for Software Bill of Materials</a>
            as defined by the [National Telecommunications and Information Administration <a href="https://www.ntia.gov/">NTIA</a>
            in response to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">U.S. Executive Order 14028</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adopting CycloneDX allows organizations to quickly meet these minimum requirements and mature into using more
            sophisticated use cases over time. CycloneDX is capable of achieving all SBOM requirements defined in the
            <a href="https://owasp.org/scvs">OWASP Software Component Verification Standard (SCVS)</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A few high-level use cases for SBOM include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Product security, architectural, and licence risk</li>
            <li>Procurement and M&A</li>
            <li>Software component transparency</li>
            <li>Supply chain transparency</li>
            <li>Vendor risk management</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>xBOM Capabilities</h2>
        <p>
            CycloneDX provides advanced supply chain capabilities for cyber risk reduction. Among these capabilities are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)</li>
            <li>Software-as-a-Service Bill of Materials (SaaSBOM)</li>
            <li>Hardware Bill of Materials (HBOM)</li>

            <li>Common Release Notes Format</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)</h3>
        <p>
            SBOMs describe the inventory of software components and services and the dependency relationships between
            them. A complete and accurate inventory of all first-party and third-party components is essential for risk
            identification. SBOMs should ideally contain all direct and transitive components and the dependency
            relationships between them.
        </p>
        <h3>Software-as-a-Service BOM (SaaSBOM)</h3>
        <p>
            SaaSBOMs provide an inventory of services, endpoints, and data flows and classifications that power
            cloud-native applications. CycloneDX is capable of describing any type of service, including microservices,
            Service Orientated Architecture (SOA), Function as a Service (FaaS), and System of Systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            SaaSBOMs complement Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) by providing a logical representation of a complex system,
            complete with an inventory of all services, their reliance on other services, endpoint URLs, data
            classifications, and the directional flow of data between services. Optionally, SaaSBOMs may also include
            the software components that make up each service.
        </p>
        <h3>Hardware Bill of Materials (HBOM)</h3>
        <p>
            CycloneDX supports many types of components, including hardware devices, making it ideal for use with consumer
            electronics, IoT, ICS, and other types of embedded devices. CycloneDX fills an important role in between
            traditional eBOM and mBOM use cases for hardware devices.
        </p>
        <h3>Machine Learning Bill of Materials (ML-BOM)</h3>
        <p>
            ML-BOMs provide transparency for machine learning models and datasets, which provide visibility into
            possible security, privacy, safety, and ethical considerations. CycloneDX standardizes model cards in a way
            where the inventory of models and datasets can be used independently or combined with the inventory of
            software and hardware components or services defined in HBOMs, SBOMs, and SaaSBOMs.
        </p>
        <h3>Cryptography Bill of Materials (CBOM)</h3>
        <p>
            A Cryptography Bill of Materials (CBOM) describes cryptographic assets and their dependencies. Discovering,
            managing, and reporting on cryptographic assets is necessary as the first step on the migration journey to
            quantum-safe systems and applications. Cryptography is typically buried deep within components used to
            compose and build systems and applications. As part of an agile cryptographic approach, organizations should
            seek to understand what cryptographic assets they are using and facilitate the assessment of the risk
            posture to provide a starting point for mitigation.
        </p>
        <h3>Operations Bill of Materials (OBOM)</h3>
        <p>
            OBOMs provide a full-stack inventory of runtime environments, configurations, and additional dependencies.
            CycloneDX is a full-stack bill of materials standard supporting entire runtime environments consisting of
            hardware, firmware, containers, operating systems, applications, and libraries. Coupled with the ability to
            specify configuration makes CycloneDX ideal for Operations Bill of Materials.
        </p>
        <h3>Manufacturing Bill of Materials (MBOM)</h3>
        <p>
            CycloneDX can describe declared and observed formulations for reproducibility throughout the product
            lifecycle of components and services. This advanced capability provides transparency into how components
            were made, how a model was trained, or how a service was created or deployed. In addition, every component
            and service in a CycloneDX BOM can optionally specify formulation and do so in existing BOMs or in dedicated
            MBOMs. By externalizing formulation into dedicated MBOMs, SBOMs can link to MBOMs for their components and
            services, and access control can be managed independently. This allows organizations to maintain tighter
            control over what parties gain access to inventory information in a BOM and what parties have access to
            MBOM information which may have higher sensitivity and data classification.
        </p>
        <h3>Bill of Vulnerabilities (BOV)</h3>
        <p>
            CycloneDX BOMs may consist solely of vulnerabilities and thus can be used to share vulnerability data
            between systems and sources of vulnerability intelligence. Complex vulnerability data can be represented,
            including the vulnerability source, references, multiple severities, risk ratings, details and
            recommendations, and the affected software and hardware, along with their versions.
        </p>
        <h3>Vulnerability Disclosure Report (VDR)</h3>
        <p>
            VDRs communicate known and unknown vulnerabilities affecting components and services. Known vulnerabilities
            inherited from the use of third-party and open-source software can be communicated with CycloneDX. Previously
            unknown vulnerabilities affecting both components and services may also be disclosed using CycloneDX, making
            it ideal for Vulnerability Disclosure \Report (VDR) use cases. CycloneDX exceeds the data field requirements
            defined in <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html">ISO/IEC 29147:2018</a> for vulnerability
            disclosure information.
        </p>
        <h3>Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX)</h3>
        <p>
            VEX conveys the exploitability of vulnerable components in the context of the product in which they're used.
            VEX is a \subset of VDR. Oftentimes, products are not affected by a vulnerability simply by including an
            otherwise vulnerable \component. VEX allows software vendors and other parties to communicate the
            exploitability status of vulnerabilities, providing clarity on the vulnerabilities that pose a risk and the
            ones that do not.
        </p>
        <h3>CycloneDX Attestations (CDXA)</h3>
        <p>
            CycloneDX Attestations enable organizations to communicate security standards, claims, and evidence about
            security requirements, and attestations to the veracity and completeness of those claims. CycloneDX
            Attestations is a way to manage "compliance as code."
        </p>
        <h3>Common Release Notes Format</h3>
        <p>
            CycloneDX standardizes release notes into a common, machine-readable format. This capability unlocks new
            workflow potential for software publishers and consumers alike. This functionality works with or without the
            Bill of Materials capabilities of the specification.
        </p>

    <emu-clause id="sec-cyclonedx-object-model">
        <h1>CycloneDX Object Model</h1>
        <p>Within the root element, CycloneDX defines the following object types:</p>
        <img src="img/Object-Model/CycloneDX-Object-Type-Overview.svg" alt="BOM Metadata">
        <p>The object types are arranged in order and contain (but are not limited to) the following types of data:</p>
        <img src="img/CycloneDX-Object-Model-Swimlane.svg" alt="CycloneDX Object Model">

        <h3>BOM Identity</h3>
        <p>
            The <code>bom</code> element has properties for <code>serialNumber</code> and <code>version</code>. Together
            these two properties form the identity of a BOM. A BOM's identity can be expressed using a BOM-Link, a formally
            registered URN capable of referencing a BOM or any component, service, or vulnerability in a BOM. Refer to the
            chapter on Relationships for more information.
        </p>

        <h4>Serial Number</h4>
        <p>
            Every BOM generated should have a unique serial number, even if the contents of the BOM have not changed over
            time. If specified, the serial number must conform to RFC-4122. The use of serial numbers is recommended.
        </p>

        <h4>Version</h4>
        <p>
            Whenever an existing BOM is modified, either manually or through automated processes, the version of the BOM
            should be incremented by 1. When a system is presented with multiple BOMs with identical serial numbers, the
            system should use the most recent version of the BOM. The default version is '1'.
        </p>

        <h3>The Anatomy of a CycloneDX BOM</h3>
        <p>The following are descriptions of the root-level elements of a CycloneDX BOM.</p>

        <h4>Metadata</h4>
        <p>
            BOM metadata includes the supplier, manufacturer, and target component for which the BOM describes. It also
            includes the tools used to create the BOM, and licence information for the BOM document itself.
        </p>
        <img src="img/Object-Model/Metadata.svg" alt="Metadata">

        <h4>Components</h4>
        <p>
            Components describe the complete inventory of first-party and third-party components. The specification can
            represent software, hardware devices, machine learning models, source code, and configurations, along with the
            manufacturer information, licence and copyright details, and complete pedigree and provenance for every component.
        </p>
        <img src="img/Object-Model/Components.svg" alt="Components">

        <h4>Services</h4>
        <p>
            Services represent external APIs that the software may call. They describe endpoint URIs, authentication
            requirements, and trust boundary traversals. The data flow between software and services can also be described,
            including the data classifications and the flow direction of each type.
        </p>
        <img src="img/Object-Model/Services.svg" alt="Services">

        <h4>Dependencies</h4>
        <p>
            CycloneDX provides the ability to describe components and their dependency on other components. The dependency
            graph is capable of representing both direct and transitive relationships. Components that depend on services
            can be represented in the dependency graph, and services that depend on other services can be represented as well.
        </p>
        <img src="img/Object-Model/Dependencies.svg" alt="Dependencies">

        <h4>Compositions</h4>
        <p>
            Compositions describe constituent parts (including components, services, and dependency relationships) and their
            completeness. The aggregate of each composition can be described as complete, incomplete, incomplete first-party
            only, incomplete third-party only, or unknown.
        </p>
        <img src="img/Object-Model/Compositions.svg" alt="Compositions">

        <h4>Vulnerabilities</h4>
        <p>
            Known vulnerabilities inherited from the use of third-party and open-source software and the exploitability of
            the vulnerabilities can be communicated with CycloneDX. Previously unknown vulnerabilities affecting both
            components and services may also be disclosed using CycloneDX, making it ideal for both vulnerability disclosure
            and VEX use cases.
        </p>
        <img src="img/Object-Model/Vulnerabilities.svg" alt="Vulnerabilities">

        <h4>Formulation</h4>
        <p>
            Formulation describes how something was manufactured or deployed. CycloneDX achieves this through the support of
            multiple formulas, workflows, tasks, and steps, which represent the declared formulation for reproduction along
            with the observed formula describing the actions which transpired in the manufacturing process.
        </p>
        <img src="img/Object-Model/Formulation.svg" alt="Formulation">

        <h4>Annotations</h4>
        <p>
            Annotations contain comments, notes, explanations, or similar textual content which provide additional context to
            the object(s) being annotated. They are often automatically added to a BOM via a tool or as a result of manual
            review by individuals or organizations. Annotations can be independently signed and verified using digital signatures.
        </p>
        <img src="img/Object-Model/Annotations.svg" alt="Annotations">

        <h4>Definitions</h4>
        <p>
            Standards, requirements, levels, and all supporting documentation are defined here. CycloneDX provides a general-purpose,
            machine-readable way to define virtually any type of standard. Security standards such as OWASP ASVS, MASVS, SCVS, and
            SAMM are available in CycloneDX format. Standards from other bodies are available as well. Additionally, organizations
            can create internal standards and represent them in CycloneDX.
        </p>
        <img src="img/Object-Model/Definitions.svg" alt="Definitions">

        <h4>Declarations</h4>
        <p>
            Declarations describe the conformance to standards. Each declaration may include attestations, claims, counter-claims,
            evidence, counter-evidence, along with conformance and confidence. Signatories can also be declared and supports
            both digital and analogue signatures. Declarations provide the basis for "compliance-as-code".
        </p>
        <img src="img/Object-Model/Declarations.svg" alt="Declarations">

        <h4>Extensions</h4>
        <p>
            Multiple extension points exist throughout the CycloneDX object model, allowing fast prototyping of new capabilities
            and support for specialized and future use cases. The CycloneDX project maintains extensions that are beneficial
            to the larger community. The project encourages community participation and the development of extensions that
            target specialized or industry-specific use cases.
