    CycloneDX is a modern standard designed to address the complexities of the software and system supply chain.
    Originating in 2017, CycloneDX has grown into a general-purpose Bill of Materials (BOM) standard capable of
    representing various types of inventories, including software, hardware, and services. CycloneDX continuously
    evolves to meet the changing needs of the industry, incorporating new features and improvements to stay ahead
    of emerging challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
    The design philosophy of CycloneDX emphasizes simplicity and ease of use, making it accessible to both technical
    and non-technical stakeholders. Despite its straightforward design, CycloneDX is a full-stack BOM format with
    advanced capabilities. Its guiding principles include easy adoption, rapid risk identification, continuous
    improvement, and high degrees of automation and extensibility.

    CycloneDX plays a crucial role in enhancing software and system transparency, providing detailed information
    about the components used in an application, including their versions, suppliers, and dependencies. This
    transparency is essential for identifying and managing risks, ensuring regulatory compliance, and building trust
    in both software and hardware systems. By offering a comprehensive and standardized way to document these
    components, CycloneDX enables organizations to achieve greater security and reliability in their supply chains,
    supporting a wide range of use cases from product security to vendor risk management.
