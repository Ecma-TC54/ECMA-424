    <h1>Introduction to CycloneDX</h1>
    <p>
        CycloneDX is a modern standard designed to address the complexities of the software and system supply chain.
        Originating in 2017, CycloneDX has grown into a general-purpose Bill of Materials (BOM) standard capable of
        representing various types of inventories, including software, hardware, and services. CycloneDX continuously
        evolves to meet the changing needs of the industry, incorporating new features and improvements to stay ahead
        of emerging challenges.

        The design philosophy of CycloneDX emphasizes simplicity and ease of use, making it accessible to both technical
        and non-technical stakeholders. Despite its straightforward design, CycloneDX is a full-stack BOM format with
        advanced capabilities. Its guiding principles include easy adoption, rapid risk identification, continuous
        improvement, and high degrees of automation and extensibility.

        CycloneDX plays a crucial role in enhancing software and system transparency, providing detailed information
        about the components used in an application, including their versions, suppliers, and dependencies. This
        transparency is essential for identifying and managing risks, ensuring regulatory compliance, and building trust
        in both software and hardware systems. By offering a comprehensive and standardized way to document these
        components, CycloneDX enables organizations to achieve greater security and reliability in their supply chains,
        supporting a wide range of use cases from product security to vendor risk management.

        This Ecma Standard was developed by Technical Committee 54 and was adopted by the General Assembly of
        December 2025.
