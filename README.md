# CycloneDX Bill of Materials Specification (ECMA-424)

This repository contains the source materials for ECMA-424, the CycloneDX Bill of Materials (BOM) standard developed
by the [OWASP Foundation](https://owasp.org) and [Ecma TC54](https://tc54.org).

## Editions and Versioning

| Ecma Edition         | CycloneDX Version      |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| ECMA-424 2nd Edition | CycloneDX v1.7 (draft) |
| ECMA-424 1st Edition | CycloneDX v1.6         |

## Documentation Generation

The documentation for versions 1.7 and later is generated using [Ecmarkup](https://github.com/tc39/ecmarkup), a tool
developed by [Ecma TC39](https://tc39.es/). This process ensures consistent and standards-compliant output suitable for
formal specification publication.

## Structure

- The `ecmarkup` sources define the normative specification.
- The JSON schema defines the machine-readable implementation.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please ensure all proposals maintain compatibility with existing CycloneDX standards and
align with ECMA editorial requirements. Refer to [https://tc54.org/contribute/](https://tc54.org/contribute/) for
details on how to contribute to the ongoing development of the standard.
